# Bharat_Intern_Projects
Internship projects for the role of Data Science Intern from Bharat Intern. Here in performed end to end Data Science project on different datasets. <br>

**Bharat-Intern_Task-1** <br>
ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with LSTM ðŸš€ <br>
Datasets Used: <br>
1. Googel Stock Prediction from Kaggle <br>
2. Netflix Stock Prediction <br>
In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to dive into the world of stock market analysis and prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. 
Technologies Used for this project, I primarily utilized the following tools and technologies: Python for data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and model implementation. 
Jupyter Notebook as the coding environment for interactive development. Keras library to build and train the LSTM model.

**Bhart_Intern-Task-2** <br>
Titanic Classification: <br>
Datasets Used: <br>
1. Titanic Survivor dataset from Kaggle <br>

Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. 
Key Features: Here,Data Preprocessing is done i;e handle missing values, encode categorical features, and prepare the data for machine learning. 
Model Building: Utilize a Random Forest Classifier & decision tree classifier to train the prediction model on the labeled training dataset. 
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy percent. Visualization: Explore survival trends based on different factors using interactive and informative plots. 
Predictions: Generate predictions for the test dataset Insights: Gain valuable insights into the factors that might have influenced survival during the Titanic disaster
